The program does the following:<br/><br/>\n","    \n","    a. It asks the user to enter an integer $n$ $\\ge 1$<br/><br/>\n","    \n","    b. Then create a function that finds the $n$th term of the convergence, where $n$ is the integer input from the previous step. i.e if the user enters 2, the output of the function should be 2.25, as this is what the convergence evaluates to when $n$ = 2 (shown here $(1 + 1/2)^2$). The first few terms of the convergence are displayed here so you can check your answers: $$(1 +\n","      1/1)^1, (1 + 1/2,)^2, (1 + 1/3)^3, \\ldots, (1 + 1/n)^n$$<br/><br/>\n","      \n","    c. Your function from part b only calculates one term of the convergence, but it would be more useful if we could get all of the terms from 1 to $n$ instead. As a result, you will modify your function from part b to calculate all terms from 1 to $n$ and store them in a list. The output of your new function will be the list of terms from 1 to n. HINT: A `for` loop would come in handy here.<br/><br/>\n","      \n","2. Your name, MacID, student number, and the date are given in comments at the top of your code before the rest of your program.<br/><br/>\n","\n","3. Your program MUST have valid Python syntax and it must run without errors. Ensure that your program runs properly by running it before you submit. <br/><br/>\n","\n","4.
